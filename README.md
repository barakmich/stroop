# stroop

A console-mode Github issue board written in [Go](http://golang.org)

## Why
I love [waffle.io](http://waffle.io) and I love [vim](http://vim.org). One thing that frustrates me about using waffle.io's pretty UI is that I have to mouse around frequently to get anything done; adding comments, assigning labels, milestones, assignees, and so on. 

I want vim, but for the project managment experience, on top of Github issues.

(In Progress)
